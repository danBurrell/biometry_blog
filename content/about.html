<h2>About the author. </h2>
Hi there, and welcome to Biometrie de la phytopathologie. I'm a statistics lecturer at the <a href="http://www.usq.edu.au">University of Southern Queensland"</a> and consultant with the <a href="https://www.usq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/ilse/crop-health">Centre for Crop Health (CCH)"</a>, where I assist researchers involved in the study of plant diseases and pests with all things statistical. 

<h2> About this site</h2>
Part of my consulting role involves assisting students and researchers to implement statistical techniques relevant to their needs using the R statistical computing environment and friends. With the events of the recent past, covid-19 and the global pandemic, I've decided to move some resources online, where they are accessible to all, even people who are locked-down in their homes. This blog is a part of that. 

Here I post about different statistical techniques relevant to plant pathologists and demonstrate how to implement them in R. I also post other information relevant to using R for reproducible scientific research. So without further ado, grab yourself a piping hot cup of java, pull up a chair and in the words of the immortal nerdy stepsister of Kylie Minogue, "Let's get statistical!!!"
