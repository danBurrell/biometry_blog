title: 10 reasons why you should learn R for as a plant pathologist
---

So, you're a biologist. You're at home in the lab, with pipettes and scalpels, specimens and a microscope. It's in your nature to surround yourself with nature. So why would you want to sit in front of a computer to learn a programming language? Statistics is just a bunch of indecipherable gobbledygook that you are forced to do to publish your work, so why choose the R statistical programming language and environment for statistical computing and data visualization? Why not just stick to a simple, menu-driven package that makes doing your favorite statistical test easy? Well, I'm here to give you 10 excellent reasons to make the effort to learn R for your biological research so that statistics becomes less gobbledygook and more the essential glue that brings all aspects of your research together into a cohesive whole. 

# Hold up a minute! What even is R?

R is an open-source (GPL) statistical environment based on the S programming language that was developed by AT&T labs in the 1980s. The name R is meant to be reminiscent of the single letter S; it's speculated that the particular choice of letter comes from the first initial of the two instigators of the R Project, **R**obert Gentleman and **R**oss Ihaka, of the Statistics Department at the University of Aukland. The [R Project](http://www.r-project.org) was started in 1995, by these two statisticians, but since then it has become one of the best, most powerful and useful statistical programming languages. Certainly it is responsible for the demise of the commercial version of S, known as S-Plus. But trends indicate that R is becoming one of the languages of choice for many researchers, despite it's zero dollar price tag, and there is evidence that more and more researchers are moving from packages such as GenStat, SPSS, Stata, and Minitab (all commercial statistical packages) to R. Why? Because R is free, and R is better! Currently R is maintained by the R-core-development team, an international team of volunteer developers who work tirelessly to ensure that R continues to provide an excellent environment for all your statistics and data analysis needs.
